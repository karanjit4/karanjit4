		<p>When I was in school, I was always fond of computer classes. I followed my interest and chose this course for my career. To be honest, I am go with the flow person. I usually don't plan and do it. I just go for it. Currently, I have not been into any engagements or internships. I want to grab this opportunity to kickstart my career as I have lot of interest in designing. I always try to be creative while I code. Whenever I have free time, I browse Youtube tutorials to explore new ideas. I actually browse Youtube a lot; for coding, for music, for movies, and many more. Apart from this, I also love delivering presentations. I have participated in presentation competition as well. After designing, I am also keen on learning database. I enjoy doing stuffs in QSEE and Oracle. My grades in database systems is higher than website development. I make an effort to grow my skills in Javascript and PHP especially for my future.</p>
